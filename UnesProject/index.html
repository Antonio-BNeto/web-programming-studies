                        of the <em>printing</em> and typesetting industry.
                        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry'sstandard
                        dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                        when an unknown printertook a galley of
                        type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
                        It has survived not only five centuries,
                        but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
                        remaining essentially unchanged.
                        It was popularised in the 1960s with
                        the release of Letraset sheets containing
                        Lorem Ipsum passages,and more recently with
                        desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
                        including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
